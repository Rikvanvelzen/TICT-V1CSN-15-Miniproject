# TICT-V1CSN-15 Miniproject

This is the final project for the course TICT-V1CSN-15 for the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. The goal of this project is to make a client-server security system with Raspberry Pi's

## Getting Started

The instructions will get you set up on the hardware and software side of this project.

### Prerequisites

For this project are no additional prerequisites required.

### Installing Software

Follow these steps to get the software running on your nodes.

1. Clone server.py to your server node

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdekruijff/TICT-V1CSN-15-Miniproject/master/server.py
```

2. Clone client.py to your server node

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdekruijff/TICT-V1CSN-15-Miniproject/master/client.py
```

3. Make sure your server node has a DHCP server running in the range of 192.168.42.1/24
4. Make sure your firewalls accept port 5555
5. Run server.py on your server

```
python3 /path/to/file/server.py
```

6. Run client.py on your client / clients

```
python3 /path/to/file/client.py
```

## Getting the hardware wired up

The following wiring scheme shows how the client nodes need to be wired up in order for the software to work.
